Markdown_Document
=================

Template for a nice looking HTML document created from a simple markdown file using Jekyll.  This document can be hosted on Github pages.  Simply fork this repository and substitute your markdown (or similar) file for 'index.md'.  The example site based on the set up and fake document provided can be found [here](https://github.com/adamvi/Markdown_Document).

I use the kramdown flavor of markdown to allow for math formulas (via MathJax - LaTeX style).

Example tables are provided using raw HTML, which sucks and kinda defeats the purpose of using markdown to begin with.  I also provide some examples of tables produced in 'pure' markdown, and in LaTeX (which requires the use of the more restrictive 'array' rather than 'tabular' environment).  None of these options are seem great to me, so if you have a better (i.e. 'pure and awesome' markdown) solution please let me know by adding an [issue](https://github.com/adamvi/Markdown_Tests2/issues) to this repository

I have recycled/refreshed/reused them here.

Enjoy!
